Kinematic and Dynamic Modeling of a 5 Degree of Freedom Robotic Arm:

In this project, the theoretical knowledge acquired during the course of "Robotics Fundamentals" has been applied to derive the forward and inverse kinemtics for the Lynx Motion 5 degrees of freedom robotic arm. Scripts have been written in Matlab. 

For the Forward Kinematics, DH parameters have been derived as the first step. Using the transformation equations, the final workspace has been plotted using Matlab. Please refer to the diagram included in the relavant folder.

Using the Forward Kinematics expression, Inverse Kinemtics problem for this robotic arm has been solved. Although, geometric approach could have been used but analytic approach has been adopted. 

As a final step, a simulation has been developed in Matlab showing multiple trajectories which the robotic arm can follow.
